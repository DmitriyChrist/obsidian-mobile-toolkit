# intro


 Welcome to my Obsidian experimentation playground.
Here you can find interesting solutions, inspiration, and life hacks.

The main goal of this repository is to improve the UI and UX of Obsidian mobile. However, many things will either work well on any device by default, or will require modifications.

I sincerely hope that the materials presented here will not leave you indifferent and I would like to receive feedback from you in the form of comments, suggestions, or ideas.

Some examples are collected from various sources, including existing GitHub repositories.
