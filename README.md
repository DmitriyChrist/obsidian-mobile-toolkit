# intro


 Dear friend, welcome to my Obsidian experimentation playground.
Here you can find interesting solutions, inspiration, and life hacks.

Most examples are collected from various sources, including existing GitHub repositories.

The main goal of this repository is to improve the UI and UX of Obsidian mobile. However, many things will either work well on any device by default, or will require modifications.
