### This behavior was implemented through the following scripts:
- [Mobile Quick Action Fix](../startup/modifHeaderNavBar.md)
- [Dynamic Backlinks & Vim button](../startup/indicatorVim.md)
	- [Programmatic Ribbon Toggle](../startup/toggleRibbon.md)
- [Mobile Gesture Navigation](../startup/bottomNavSwipe.md)
- [Mobile Status Bar Tab History Navigation](../startup/navStatusBar.md)
