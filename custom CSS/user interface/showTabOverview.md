Let's examine TabOverview in the mobile version of Obsidian.
We have the following:
- Open tabs are displayed as tiles.
- The last active tab has additional highlighting.
- Tabs are grouped by groups.
- Viewing open tabs is done through vertical scrolling.

Based on this, the following customization possibilities can be identified:
- [Customizing TabOverview Tabs Display](tabOverview/Customizing%20TabOverview%20Tabs.md)
-  [Customizing Last Active Tab Appearance](tabOverview/Customizing%20Last%20Active%20Tab%20Appearance.md)
- [Customizing Tab Navigation in TabOverview](../../custom%20JS/articles/Customizing%20Tab%20Navigation%20in%20TabOverview.md)

But first, I suggest adding a simple CSS snippet that will add visual separation between tab groups:
[horizontalLineForGroup](tabOverview/horizontalLineForGroup.md)
