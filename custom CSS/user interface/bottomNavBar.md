## Description
We hide the bottomNavBar but do not remove it from the DOM tree.
Note:
Currently, the bottomNavBar hides when the virtual keyboard appears. Interestingly, if you override its position using CSS, it still disappears when the keyboard shows up.
Later, I need to add some old examples, but with this behavior, it’s more of an annoyance in daily use.
