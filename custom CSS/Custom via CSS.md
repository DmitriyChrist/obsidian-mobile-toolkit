## Important
Primarily, the styles were selected, modified, or developed for mobile phones.
When used on a computer, the result may differ from what is expected.

## Recommendation
Combine different snippets into one logical document. This allows for better code maintenance, is useful for debugging, and convenient for future expansion. 
For very large style systems, consider logically dividing them into thematic blocks (e.g., base, interface, theme) to avoid cumbersome "spaghetti code" files.
